## 🎨 What are 'design tokens'?

> “A Style Dictionary uses design tokens to define styles once and use those styles on any platform or language. It provides a single place to create and edit your styles, and exports these tokens to all the places you need.”  
> — *Amazon*

Design tokens are the single source of truth for your product’s visual style, they capture design decisions such as:

- 🎨 **Colours** (primary, secondary, background, border)
- 🔠 **Typography** (font families, weights, sizes, line heights)
- 📐 **Spacing** (margins, paddings, gaps)
- 🧱 **Components** (border radius, shadows, z-index)

These tokens are used to ensure **consistency** across multiple platforms and UI libraries (web, iOS, Android, emails, PDFs, etc.) without duplicating style logic in each codebase.

This repository implements **design tokens** using [Amazon’s Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary), which compiles token definitions (stored in platform-agnostic JSON files) into platform-specific formats such as:

- ✅ SCSS variables
- ✅ CSS custom properties (`--tokens`)
- ✅ JavaScript constants
- ✅ JSON files for use in Figma, Storybook, or frontend frameworks

### 🧠 Why use Design Tokens?

- 🔁 **Consistency**: One change updates all platforms
- 🧩 **Scalability**: Add themes without rewriting UI
- 🤝 **Collaboration**: Designers and developers share a common language
- 🛡️ **Governance**: Enforce brand guidelines automatically

This package serves as the **Queensland Government’s baseline design token system**, and is intended to be:

- ✅ Extended per department/project
- ✅ Versioned and built into pipelines
- ✅ Source-controlled for audit and collaboration

## 🧩 Extending Design Tokens

<a id="create-your-own-theme"></a>
### ✏️ Create your own theme

You can fork this repository and create your own theme by extending the design tokens.

1. **Fork this repo**
2. **Switch to the example branch** for guidance:

```bash
git checkout custom-tokens-and-themes-example
```

Your forked files will remain untouched when pulling updates from the upstream repo.

### 🛠️ After creating a custom theme

Run the following to validate:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run build:package
```

✅ You should see no errors.

## 🔄 Tokens Studio integration

Using [Tokens Studio](https://docs.tokens.studio) to update tokens directly from Figma is supported.

> ⚠️ Sometimes Tokens Studio may overwrite or add `$metadata` or `$theme` tokens.  
> To avoid issues, we preserve `.original` copies of expected formats for easy reversion.
